# Carbon Design System roadmap

This repository houses the [Carbon Design System roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/roadmap/projects/1) so you can learn about what we're working on and what we have planned for the future. Have questions or comments? Join the discussion in Carbon's [primary repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions) where backlog specifics live.

## Guide to the roadmap

Each roadmap item is an issue with one or many labels to indicate its related libraries and/or services. Instead of commenting on roadmap items in this repository, each roadmap item will have linked issues to other repositories where the work and discussions are actively taking place.

## Contributing

This roadmap is intended for higher-level items across our design system. As such, it's not a place to document bugs or daily/weekly tasks. If the feature or enhancement is big enough to share in a Medium article, then it's worth including it in this roadmap.

* Use the issue template to add roadmap items
* Lock issue conversations so we can concentrate comments and discussions in the repositories where the work is taking place
* Once there's a related GitHub issue for a roadmap item, add that issue as a comment to the roadmap item
* Once a roadmap item has been delivered, add a comment linking to the release notes, announcement, etc. and close the issue
