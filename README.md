# Carbon Design System roadmap

This repository houses the [Carbon Design System roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/roadmap/projects/1) so you can learn about what we're working on and what we have planned for the future. Have questions or comments? Join the discussion in Carbon's [primary repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions) for backlog specifics.

## Using the roadmap

Each roadmap item is an issue with one or many labels to indicate its related libraries, services, and the status of each. Instead of commenting on roadmap items in this repository, each roadmap item will have linked issues to other repositories where the work and discussions are actively taking place.

### Libraries

* **Carbon Angular** - Angular implementation of Carbon components
* **Carbon Axure** - Axure design kit of common visual assets like color, type, iconography, and components
* **Carbon Charts** - Data visualizations implemented as Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript
* **Carbon Components** - Component styles and vanilla JavaScript
* **Carbon Elements** - IBM Design Language elements like colors, type, iconography, and more
* **Carbon Figma** - Figma design kit of common visual assets like color, type, iconography, and components
* **Carbon Gatsby Theme** - GatsbyJS theme to build websites with Carbon

* **Carbon Website** - [Carbon Design System website](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com)
* **IDL Website** - [IBM Design Language website](https://www.ibm.com/design/language)

_More services will be added as needed._

### Status

* **Experimental** - Exploratory efforts, no delivery committments yet
* **Alpha** - Partially complete, limited documentation, no delivery timeline
* **Beta** - Mostly complete, fully documented, published timeline
* **RC** - Release candidate, final quality assurance
* **GA** - Generally available and published via package latest tags

### Teams

_GitHub teams in the `carbon-design-system` organization might be added in the future and mapped to various libraries, services, and/or roadmap items to provide more clarity on who is maintaining and contributing to what._

## Contributing to the roadmap

This roadmap is intended for higher-level items across our design system. As such, it's not a place to document bugs or daily/weekly tasks. If the feature or enhancement is big enough to share in a Medium article, then it's worth including it in this roadmap.

* Use the issue template to add roadmap items
* Lock issue conversations so we can concentrate comments and discussions in the repositories where the work is taking place
* Once there's a related GitHub issue for a roadmap item, add that issue as a comment to the roadmap item
* Once a roadmap item has been delivered, add a comment linking to the release notes, announcement, etc. and close the issue

## Issue template

The following issue template is used to create roadmap items.
