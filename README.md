# Carbon Design System roadmap

This repository houses the [Carbon Design System roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/roadmap/projects/1). More information coming here soon.

## Guide to the roadmap

Coming soon.

## Contributing

This roadmap is intended for higher-level items across our our design system. As such, it's not a place to document bugs or daily/weekly tasks. If the feature or enhancement is big enough to share in a Medium article, then it's worth including it in this roadmap.

* Use the issue template to add roadmap items
* Upon creating the roadmap item, lock the conversation so we can concentrate comments and discussions in the repositories where the work is taking place
* Once a roadmap item effort has started and there's a related GitHub issue for it, add that issue as a comment to the roadmap item
* Once a roadmap item has been delivered, add a comment linking to the release notes, changelog, announcement, etc. and close the issue
