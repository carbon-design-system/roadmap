# Carbon Design System roadmap

This repository houses the [Carbon Design System roadmap](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/roadmap/projects/1) so you can learn about what we're working on and what we have planned for the future. Have questions or comments? Join the discussion in Carbon's [primary repository](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/discussions) for backlog specifics.

## Using the roadmap

Each roadmap item is an issue with one or many labels to indicate its related libraries, services, and the status of each. Instead of commenting on roadmap items in this repository, each roadmap item will have linked issues to other repositories where the work and discussions are actively taking place.

## Contributing to the roadmap

This roadmap is intended for higher-level items across our design system. As such, it's not a place to document bugs or daily/weekly tasks. If the feature or enhancement is big enough to share in a Medium article, then it's worth including it in this roadmap.

* Use the issue template to add roadmap items
* Lock issue conversations so we can concentrate comments and discussions in the repositories where the work is taking place
* Once there's a related GitHub issue for a roadmap item, add that issue as a comment to the roadmap item
* Once a roadmap item has been delivered, add a comment linking to the release notes, announcement, etc. and close the issue

## Disclaimer

Any statement in this repository that is not purely historical is considered a forward-looking statement. The forward-looking roadmap does not represent a commitment, guarantee, obligation or promise to deliver any library or service, or to deliver anything by any particular date, and is intended to outline the general design and development plans.
